# Codex Expansion Log

- **Reso-Tiling Section**: Introduced non-periodic geometric resonance formalism based on Einstein tiling.  
- **Resilience Tensor**: Defined survivability curvature in tension-entropy space.  
- **RCT Proof**: Formalized the resonance cascade theorem across TSR layers.  
- **Tension-Entropy Duality**: Connected entropy gradients to field tension curvature.  
- **Mathematical Enhancements**: Added cohomological logic and category-theoretic morphism maps.
