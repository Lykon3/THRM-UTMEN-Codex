# THRM-UTMEN Codex

**Recursive Expansion Codex for the Tensional Harmonic Recursion Model (THRM) + Unified Tension-Mediated Exchange Networks (UTMEN)**

## Purpose

This Codex serves as a living research log, simulation archive, and theoretical testing ground for emergent properties, frontier equations, and interdisciplinary integrations of the THRM-UTMEN framework.

All files are time-stamped and versioned to support recursive proof of IP, intellectual continuity, and lateral innovation beyond the stable core repository.

## Integration With Main Repo

This codex is linked to the stable [`THRM-UTMEN`](https://github.com/Lykon3/THRM-UTMEN) repository. While that repo is optimized for formal publication, this one embraces experimentation, variation, and conceptual drift.
